= tex2svg, in Node, with MathJax!

== What is it?

`tex2svg` is a simple Node.js script which takes in TeX math equations via CLI arguments and returns the SVG to the STDOUT.
The STDOUT can then be piped into SVG files.

== Example usage

Examples are in the link:./Makefile[`Makefile`].

Here's Euler's identity, though!

[source,sh]
----
node ./tex2svg.js "e^{i \\pi} + 1 = 0" > euler.svg
----

== Compilation and usage

No compiling, since it's Node. Just run `npm install` to get MathJax.

For usage, see the link:./Makefile[`Makefile`].

The currently supported flags include:
